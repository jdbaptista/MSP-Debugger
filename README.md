This project is a combination of software and hardware that is designed to display the assembly instructions flashed on an MSP430G2553, specifically the 20 pin DIP package. The PCB files are for Kicad 7, and the software is currently being written for an MSP430F5529 and developed on the MSP-EXP430F5529LP development board with debugging information sent through the board's uart to usb bridge on the MSP-FET.

In Progress Features in order of precedence:
- Completed JTAG driver
- Debounced Switches
- Disassembler
- Interaction with the LCD screen
- ISRs for button interation
