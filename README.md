This project is a combination of software and hardware that is designed to display the assembly instructions flashed on an MSP430G2553, specifically the 20 pin DIP package. The PCB files are for Kicad 7, and the software is currently for the ESP32-S2, although I am porting the code to an MSP430G2553 to allow writing capabilities to the software and to learn programming with the MSP430 in C. This project is currently in-progress and not in a finished state.

In Progress Features in order of precedence:
- MSP430 as central compute unit
- Debounced Switches
- Disassembler
- Interaction with the LCD screen
- Interrupt Service Routines
